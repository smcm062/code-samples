Top of the list would have to be Solomon Shereshevsky, who remembered every single thing he&rsquo;d ever come across &ndash; a great skill to have when it came to party tricks, but enough to send him crackers. And then there&rsquo;s Delbert Trew who spends more time than you can imagine thinking about something very sharp indeed: barbed wire. You can&rsquo;t go past Samuel Morse, either, who was a famous portrait painter before he gave his name to the code he invented. What a genius! And we&rsquo;re pretty taken with Noel Turner, who was smart enough to get around some pretty weird New Zealand laws to invent a car that, for a while, was a huge success. As well, you&rsquo;ll find stories on a cross-dressing spy, a couple of Sydney nerds who revolutionised modern music, court illustration, big wheels, the dubious science of controlling the weather and a whole stack of other stuff.<\/p>\n<p>143 Pages<\/p>","weight":1,"width":0,"depth":0,"height":0,"price":12.99,"cost_price":0,"retail_price":0,"sale_price":0,"map_price":0,"tax_class_id":0,"product_tax_code":"","calculated_price":12.99,"categories":[20,23],"brand_id":0,"option_set_id":null,"option_set_display":"right","inventory_level":0,"inventory_warning_level":0,"inventory_tracking":"none","reviews_rating_sum":0,"reviews_count":0,"total_sold":0,"fixed_cost_shipping_price":0,"is_free_shipping":false,"is_visible":true,"is_featured":false,"related_products":[-1],"warranty":"","bin_picking_number":"0","layout_file":"product.html","upc":"","mpn":"","gtin":"","search_keywords":"","availability":"available","availability_description":"","gift_wrapping_options_type":"any","gift_wrapping_options_list":[],"sort_order":0,"condition":"New","is_condition_shown":false,"order_quantity_minimum":0,"order_quantity_maximum":0,"page_title":"","meta_keywords":[],"meta_description":"","date_created":"2015-07-03T20:55:30+00:00","date_modified":"2019-09-15T19:49:27+00:00","view_count":63,"preorder_release_date":null,"preorder_message":"","is_preorder_only":false,"is_price_hidden":false,"price_hidden_label":"","custom_url":{"url":"\/smith-journal-13\/","is_customized":false},"base_variant_id":74,"open_graph_type":"product","open_graph_title":"","open_graph_description":"","open_graph_use_meta_description":true,"open_graph_use_product_name":true,"open_graph_use_image":true},"meta":{}}
